            The West Indies men's cricket team, nicknamed The Windies,[10] is a men's cricket team representing the mainly English-speaking countries and territories in the Caribbean region and administered by Cricket West Indies. The players on this composite team are selected from a chain of fifteen Caribbean nation-states and territories. As of 26 November 2022, the West Indies cricket team is ranked eighth in Tests, and tenth in ODIs and seventh in T20Is in the official ICC rankings.[11]

            From the mid-late 1970s to the early 1990s, the West Indies team was the strongest in the world in both Test and One Day International cricket. A number of cricketers who were considered among the best in the world have hailed from the West Indies: Garfield Sobers, Lance Gibbs, George Headley, Brian Lara, Vivian Richards, Clive Lloyd, Malcolm Marshall, Alvin Kallicharran, Andy Roberts, Rohan Kanhai, Frank Worrell, Gordon Greenidge, Clyde Walcott, Everton Weekes, Curtly Ambrose, Desmond Haynes, Michael Holding, Courtney Walsh, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Joel Garner and Wes Hall have all been inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame
